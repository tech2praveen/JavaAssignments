This is an analysis on access specifiers.

Let's begin with understanding the structure of the java project that I have created.
a) There are two packages com.demo.firstPackage and com.demo.SecondPackage.
b) firstPackage consists of two java files calculator and SamePackageTest , SecondPackage consists of Test1 and Test2.
c) calculator class have 4 methods with respective access specifiers public,private,protected and default. 

1)Use of protected, public and default variables and methods are allowed in subclass.Private don't have access.

2)protected variables and methods can only be accessed by subclasses in another package or any class with in the 
  package of protected members class.protected specifier is not applied to class and interfaces.
  
3)private variables and methods which declared as private can be accessed within the same class to which they belong.
  Using private specifier is used to achieve encapsulation which is used for hiding data.
  
4) Default if you don't declare any specifier,it will follow the default accessiblity level.Classes,Variables,methods can be default.
By using default specifier we can access class ,method, or variable which belongs to same package,but not from outside this package.

5) public Classes, methods, and variables which are declared as public can be accessed from any other class in the Java program ,
   whether they are in same package or another package.
